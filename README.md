# ** HR Analytics – Improvement of Retention of Employees 		**

●	The Department of HR noticed that decline in number of their employees over a time period. To diagnose the cause of this attrition, they needed a way to analyze this. I streamlined a dashboard in Power BI using the data provided.

●	With this dashboard, HR team was able to gain insights into different departments of employees where they loosing number and help in regaining their retention of employees to grow the company in smooth manner.
