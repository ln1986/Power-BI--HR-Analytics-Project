# ** HR Analytics â€“ Improvement of Retention of Employees **		

**Problem statement**

X company which was established few years back is facing around 20% attrition rate for the couple of years. And it's majorly affecting the company in many aspects. In order to understand why employees are leaving the company and reduce the attrition rate, X company has approached HR analytics consultancy for analyzing the data they have.

I worked in this project as the HR analyst role and built a dashboard which can help the organization to take the data driven decision.

1. Better package for their skill set and experience

4. Better work culture

**Additional reasons to quit their job**
1. Health issues
2. Maternity break
3. start up ideas
 
**Major insights from the Dashboard**

2. Most of them had very low Job statisfaction.
3. Employees in the age group of 29-35 have left the most.
4. In the Job level 2, most of the research scientist left the company, even though they were paid more than what the current employees are getting paid.
5. Average salary of managers who left the company was 7 thousand lesser compared to those who stayed in the company.
